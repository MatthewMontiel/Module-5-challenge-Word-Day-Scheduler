Work Day Scheduler

Created a work day scheduler that uses day.js and local storage to update the color of time blocks based on time of day. 

## Description

When you click the time block it will allow you to put in an item for your schedule. It will then save this item using the local storage. The color of the time blocks change in real time with day.js
